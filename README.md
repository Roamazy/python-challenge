        Pybank and Pypol folders each have: 
            - A data set in 'Resources'
            - A script named main.py
            - An analysis of the dataset in 'Analysis', output by the script

Notes: 
Looking back, I could have definitely written more optimized code for both Pybank and Pypol.
For Pybank in particular, I have a great deal of repetition. When trying to cut it down, though, I started running into a good amount of errors.
Given a bit more time, I'm sure I'd be able to optimzie better, but the results are accurate regardless!
